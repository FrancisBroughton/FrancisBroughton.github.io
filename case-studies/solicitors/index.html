   <h1>Improving the user experience of buying a house through a solicitor</h1>

   <p>Most people in the UK use a solicitor to buy or sell a property.</p>

   <p>Some of the top complaints about conveyancing services in the UK are:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Paperbased processes</li>
     <li>Documents going missing in the post</li>
     <li>Confusing legal jargon</li>
     <li>Low levels of customer service</li>
     <li>Lack of communication making things slow</li>
   </ul>

   <p>I ran a design sprint to explore the problem and created a prototype of a digital service.</p>
   

   <h2>Setting the Stage</h2>

   <p>I started by thinking about who the users are, the problems they have and the outcomes they need in a workshop called <a href="https://www.hollidazed.co.uk/2015/07/28/frame-the-problem/" class="link-color">framing the problem</a>.</p>   
   <p>I used a fun retro board for the workshop</p>

   </div>

   <h2>Mapping the service journey</h2>
   <p>I broke down the buying and selling journey and decided the scope was too big for MVP.</p>

   </div>

   <h2>Picking a user group</h2>
   <p>I decided to focus on the persona of a first time buyer. I could see from user journey mapping that steps in the first time buyer journey could be repeated for all other users and so would become the core journey. </p>

   <h2>Mapping the user journey</h2>
   <p>I mapped the user journey for a buyer in more detail. I decided I would design and prototype the onboarding process.</p>
   <p>This time I used Miro</p>

   </div>

   <h2>Design research</h2>
   <p>I then conducted online research on good user onboarding experience.</p>
   <p>I like the clean and quick onboarding process of Bulb, boughtbymany and monzo.</p>
   <div class="image-wrapper ">
    <img src="/images/boughtbymany.png" alt="photo of complete user journey" >
   </div>
   <div class="image-wrapper ">
    <img src="/images/bulb.png" alt="snapshot of questions on user journey" >
   </div>

   <h2>Wireframes & sketching</h2>
   <p>After completing the user journey, I then sketched wireframes of what a first time buyer user journey will look like on the first iteration.</p>
   <div class="image-wrapper ">
    <img src="/images/sketch1.jpeg" alt="wireframe sketches" >
   </div>
   <div class="image-wrapper ">
    <img src="/images/sketch2.jpeg" alt="wireframe sketches" >
   </div>
   <div class="image-wrapper ">
    <img src="/images/sketch3.jpeg" alt="wireframe sketches" >
   </div>

   <h2>Prototype</h2>
   <p>I then made a <a class="link-color" href="https://solicitor-ptype.herokuapp.com/">prototype</a>. I used the GDS prototyping kit because it has widely tested components and principles.</p> 
    

   <h2>How will we measure success?</h2>
   <p>Success will be measured using quantitative and qualitative methods. Using high volume quantitative data to show pain points so that qualitative data can then be captured to understand where there is a need for design iteration.</p>
